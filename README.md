# Probabilistic Reasoning

### Ben Williams '25 - November 2023

To test this project, run the `gui_illustration.py` file. The `cs1lib.py` file along with some sections of the `ColoredMaze.py` file were not made by me, but were a part of the course materials at Dartmouth.

More information on the implementation, testing, and other details can be found in the `report.md` file or in the `probabilistic_reasoning.pdf` file.
